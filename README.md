# marp-dev-preview

A lightweight CLI tool for previewing **Marp markdown slide decks** with live reloading, navigation, and development-focused features.  

Unlike the `marp-cli -s` option‚Äîwhich is primarily meant for presenting‚Äîthis tool is designed specifically for **authoring and iterating** on slides. It provides a live preview server similar to the Marp VS Code extension, but in a terminal-friendly, editor-agnostic way.  

Originally built as a dependency for the [marp-dev-preview.nvim](https://github.com/boborbt/marp-dev-preview.nvim) NeoVim plugin, it can also be used **standalone** or as a dependency in other projects.

## üîó Integration with Other Tools

The preview server exposes a simple **HTTP API** for controlling slides.  

- Reload the document (the server will parse the received markdown content and incrementally update the presentation). 

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
         -H "Content-Type: text/markdown" \
         -d "$(cat file-with-updated-content.md)" \ 
         http://localhost:8080/api/reload
    ```

- Go to the first slide containing `"my awesome text"`:  
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"command": "find", "string": "my awesome text"}' \
        http://localhost:8080/api/command
    ```

- Jump directly to slide 3:  

    ```bash
    curl -X POST
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"command": "goto", "slide": 3}' \     
        http://localhost:8080/api/command
    ```
